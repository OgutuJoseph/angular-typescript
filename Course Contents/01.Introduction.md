- Keeps your code evergreen.
- Supported by all major libraries and frameworks.

## Type Safety
- Keeps your application free from Type Errors.
- Languages like C#, Java are example of Type Safe languages.
- Keeps your JS code free from undefined null values.
- In TS, Types are stripped when your code is converted to JS.
